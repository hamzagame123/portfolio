## 📝 DETAILED SCRIPT

### PART 1: OPENING & LANDING PAGE (1 minute)

**[SCREEN: Landing page at http://localhost:5000 or your hosted URL]**

> "Good morning/afternoon everyone. My name is Hamza Galbete, and I'm an interaction design student passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences.

> Today I'll walk you through my portfolio, which showcases two case studies that represent my design philosophy: **designing experiences that matter**.

**[Scroll slowly through the landing page]**

> As you can see, my landing page establishes my personal brand with a clean, modern aesthetic. The dark theme with lime green accents creates visual hierarchy and draws attention to key elements.

> I've included two main projects:
> - **Locavore** - a sustainable food marketplace
> - **Smart Image Renamer** - an AI-powered productivity tool

> Both projects tackle real problems but in very different domains—one in sustainability and community, the other in AI and automation.

**[Point to navigation and contact section]**

> The site includes easy navigation, an about section explaining my design philosophy, and a contact form for potential collaborators or employers to reach me.

### PART 2: LOCAVORE - BRIEF OVERVIEW (1.5 minutes)

**[Click on Locavore case study]**

> Let me briefly show you Locavore. This was a UX case study where I designed a mobile marketplace connecting conscious consumers directly with local farmers.

**[Scroll through hero section]**

> The core challenge was: **How do you build trust between strangers in a food marketplace?**

**[Scroll to show wireframes section]**

> I went through a full design process—from research and personas to wireframes and prototyping. You can see here my progression from low-fidelity wireframes to the final design.

**[Scroll to prototype section - briefly show the interactive app]**

> The final deliverable was this fully interactive prototype. Key features include:
> - Location-based farm discovery
> - Trust signals like verified badges and ratings
> - Sustainability tracking showing CO₂ saved per order
> - Direct messaging between buyers and farmers

**[Quick interaction with prototype - tap through 2-3 screens]**

> The design prioritizes building trust at every touchpoint, from the farmer profiles to the checkout confirmation.

> Now, let me dive deeper into my main case study...

### PART 3: SMART IMAGE RENAMER - IN-DEPTH (5 minutes)

**[Navigate to Smart Image Renamer case study]**

#### 3.1 Introduction & Problem (45 seconds)

> Smart Image Renamer is an AI-powered tool that transforms cryptic filenames like 'DSC_8472.jpg' into descriptive, searchable names like 'sunset-beach-california.jpg'.

**[Scroll to problem section]**

> **The Problem:** Creative professionals—photographers, designers, marketers—deal with thousands of image files. They waste hours manually renaming files, or worse, they can't find images because they're buried under meaningless names.

> I interviewed photographers and designers who described spending up to 30 minutes after every shoot just organizing files. That's time taken away from actual creative work.

#### 3.2 Design Process & Research (1 minute)

**[Scroll to user research section]**

> My research revealed three key insights:

> **First:** Users are skeptical of AI. They've been burned by tools that make irreversible changes without warning.

> **Second:** File management is emotional. These aren't just files—they're memories, client work, years of creative output.

> **Third:** The existing solutions were either too technical for average users or too limited in functionality.

**[Scroll to user journey section]**

> This informed my user journey design. Notice how I mapped not just actions, but emotions—from initial frustration with messy files, through cautious optimism when trying the tool, to final relief when it works.

#### 3.3 Key Design Decisions (1.5 minutes)

**[Scroll to design/features section]**

> Let me walk you through my key design decisions:

**[Point to relevant UI elements as you mention them]**

> **Decision 1: Preview Before Commit**
> Users can see exactly what names the AI will generate BEFORE any files are changed. This builds trust by making AI behavior transparent.

> **Decision 2: One-Click Undo**
> Every rename operation can be undone instantly. This addresses the fear of irreversible changes and encourages experimentation.

> **Decision 3: Smart Detection**
> The tool only renames files with gibberish names. If a file already has a meaningful name like 'team-photo-2024.jpg', it's left alone. Users maintain control.

> **Decision 4: Visual Thumbnails**
> Instead of just showing filenames, I display image thumbnails so users can visually verify that the AI's description matches what they see.

**[Scroll to design challenges section]**

> The biggest UX challenge was **making AI feel trustworthy**. AI is a black box—users can't see how it "thinks." My solution was radical transparency: showing the AI's confidence level, allowing manual overrides, and never hiding what the tool is doing.

#### 3.4 Technical Pivot & MVP (45 seconds)

**[Scroll to tech pivot section if visible]**

> An interesting part of this project was the technical pivot. I initially planned a desktop Electron app, but realized that created friction—users had to download and install software before they could even try it.

> So I built a web-based MVP first. This let users experience the core functionality immediately in their browser, proving the concept before committing to a desktop app.

> This taught me an important lesson: **validate the experience, not the technology**.

#### 3.5 Live Demo (1 minute)

**[Click "Launch Web App" button to open Smart Image Renamer web app]**

> Let me show you the working prototype.

**[In the web app, demonstrate:]**

> Here's the interface. Notice the clean, focused design—there's no clutter, just the essential actions.

> To use it, you would:
> 1. Enter your Gemini API key (this stays local for privacy)
> 2. Drag and drop images or a folder
> 3. The AI analyzes each image and suggests descriptive names
> 4. Review the suggestions in the preview panel
> 5. Click to rename—or undo if needed

> The dark interface was a deliberate choice. User testing showed that a polished, professional appearance increased perceived reliability of the AI.

#### 3.6 Results & Learnings (30 seconds)

**[Navigate back to case study, scroll to results section]**

> Key takeaways from this project:

> **One:** Trust is the product. When users hand control to AI, every design decision must answer: "Does this make users feel safe?"

> **Two:** Polish signals quality. The same functionality in a basic UI was perceived as less reliable than in a polished interface.

> **Three:** Design for undo. Reversibility transforms a scary AI tool into a safe playground for experimentation.

## ❓ COMPREHENSIVE Q&A SECTION

### GENERAL PORTFOLIO QUESTIONS

**Q: Why did you choose these two projects for your portfolio?**
> They demonstrate range. Locavore shows I can design for community, sustainability, and trust in a B2C marketplace. Smart Image Renamer shows I can tackle AI/automation challenges and technical product design. Together, they prove I can adapt my design approach to very different problem spaces.

**Q: What's your design process?**
> I follow a user-centered process: Research → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test → Iterate. But I adapt based on constraints. For Smart Image Renamer, I prioritized getting a working prototype fast to validate assumptions. For Locavore, I spent more time on research since the trust problem was more nuanced.

**Q: How long did each project take?**
> Locavore was a 4-week solo project. Smart Image Renamer has been ongoing—the MVP took about 3 weeks, with continued iteration based on feedback.

**Q: What tools do you use?**
> For design: Figma for UI/UX, pen and paper for early ideation. For prototyping: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for interactive prototypes, React for more complex interactions. For research: interviews, surveys, and competitive analysis.

**Q: What makes your portfolio unique?**
> The interactive prototypes. Most portfolios show static mockups. Mine let you actually experience the designs—click through Locavore, use the Smart Image Renamer. This demonstrates not just design skills but also technical implementation ability.

### LOCAVORE-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

**Q: Why a food marketplace app?**
> Food systems are broken—farmers get 15% of retail prices while consumers pay premium costs. I wanted to explore how design could remove middlemen and build direct trust between producers and consumers.

**Q: How did you approach the trust problem?**
> Multi-layered trust signals: verified badges for authenticated farmers, star ratings from real buyers, direct messaging before purchase, farm photos and stories, and years of farming experience displayed prominently.

**Q: Did you do user testing?**
> I conducted interviews with potential users—both consumers interested in local food and small-scale farmers. Key insight: buyers wanted to know WHO they were buying from before WHAT they were buying. This led me to prioritize farm profiles over product listings.

**Q: Why the green color palette?**
> Green evokes nature, freshness, and sustainability—core values of the app. The earthy tones (terracotta, amber) add warmth and approachability, avoiding the cold "tech startup" aesthetic.

**Q: What would you do differently?**
> More farmer interviews earlier. I had good consumer research but could have better understood farmer pain points around technology adoption and digital literacy.

**Q: How does the sustainability tracking work?**
> It calculates CO₂ saved based on distance—local produce travels an average of 10km versus 1,500+ miles for supermarket produce. The gamification (Earth Guardian levels) makes abstract environmental impact feel tangible and rewarding.

### SMART IMAGE RENAMER-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

**Q: Why did you choose to work with AI?**
> AI is reshaping how we interact with technology, but most AI tools feel opaque and untrustworthy. I wanted to explore how interaction design can make AI feel safe, transparent, and user-controlled.

**Q: How does the AI actually work?**
> It uses Google's Gemini Vision API to analyze image content and generate descriptive filenames. The AI "sees" the image and describes what's in it—people, places, objects, colors, mood.

**Q: What happens if the AI gets it wrong?**
> Three safeguards: Preview before commit (see suggestions before any changes), one-click undo (reverse any rename instantly), and manual override (edit any suggested name before applying).

**Q: Why a web app instead of a desktop app?**
> Reduced friction. Users can try it immediately without downloading anything. This was strategic—prove the concept works before asking users to install software.

**Q: What about privacy? Are images uploaded to a server?**
> Great question. Images are processed client-side and sent directly to Google's API—they never touch my servers. The API key is stored locally in the user's browser. I prioritized privacy because these could be personal photos or confidential client work.

**Q: How did you handle the "black box" problem with AI?**
> Transparency at every step. Users see what the AI suggests, can compare old vs. new names, see thumbnails to verify accuracy, and maintain full control over what gets renamed. The AI is a helper, not a decision-maker.

**Q: What were the biggest technical challenges?**
> Handling large batches of files without freezing the UI. I implemented progressive loading so users see results as they're generated rather than waiting for everything to process.

**Q: Why the dark theme?**
> User testing insight: the same functionality in a dark, polished interface was perceived as more professional and trustworthy than in a light, basic UI. For an AI tool handling important files, perceived reliability matters.

**Q: What's next for this project?**
> A desktop Electron app with advanced features: folder watching for automatic renaming of new files, batch operations UI for processing entire directories, and customizable naming templates.

### DESIGN PHILOSOPHY QUESTIONS

**Q: What's your design philosophy?**
> Design with purpose. Every decision should solve a real problem. I avoid decoration for decoration's sake. If an element doesn't serve the user, it shouldn't exist.

**Q: How do you balance aesthetics and usability?**
> They're not opposing forces—good aesthetics ARE usability. Visual hierarchy guides attention, color communicates meaning, and polish signals quality. A beautiful interface that's unusable is bad design, but so is a usable interface that looks unprofessional.

**Q: How do you handle design critiques?**
> I separate my ego from my work. Critique is about making the design better, not about me. I ask clarifying questions, look for patterns in feedback, and prioritize changes that address user needs over personal preferences.

**Q: How do you stay updated on design trends?**
> I follow design publications (Nielsen Norman Group, UX Collective), study products I admire, and most importantly, I observe how real people interact with technology in everyday life.

---

### TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

**Q: Can you code?**
> Yes. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I believe designers who can prototype in code create better designs because they understand implementation constraints.

**Q: Did you build the prototypes yourself?**
> Yes, both the Locavore interactive prototype and the Smart Image Renamer web app are hand-coded. This gives me full control over interactions and animations.

**Q: Why is coding important for interaction designers?**
> It bridges the gap between design and development. I can prototype micro-interactions, test feasibility of ideas, and communicate more effectively with developers.

---

### CAREER & FUTURE QUESTIONS

**Q: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?**
> Leading interaction design for products that leverage emerging technology—AI, AR, voice interfaces—while keeping humans at the center. I want to shape how people interact with intelligent systems.

**Q: What type of company do you want to work for?**
> A company that values design as a strategic function, not just decoration. Ideally working on products that have real impact—whether that's sustainability, accessibility, or making complex technology approachable.

**Q: What's a design challenge you'd love to tackle?**
> Making AI interfaces more transparent and trustworthy at scale. As AI becomes embedded in everything, the interaction design choices we make now will shape public perception and trust for decades.

---

### CURVEBALL QUESTIONS

**Q: What's your biggest weakness as a designer?**
> I can over-research. Sometimes I delay ideation because I want more data. I've learned to set time-boxes for research and embrace "good enough" information to start designing.

**Q: Tell me about a design you're not proud of.**
> Early in Locavore, I designed a separate "sustainability" page. Testing showed users never visited it. I learned that important information should be integrated throughout the experience, not siloed.

**Q: What if a stakeholder disagrees with your design decision?**
> I'd ask them to articulate the concern—often disagreements stem from different assumptions. If we can't align, I propose testing both approaches with users and letting data decide.

**Q: How do you handle tight deadlines?**
> Prioritize ruthlessly. Identify the core user problem and solve that first. Polish and edge cases can come later. I'd rather ship a focused solution than an incomplete everything.
